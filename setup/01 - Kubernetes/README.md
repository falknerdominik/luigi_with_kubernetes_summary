# Setup Kubernetes

Kubernetes will be used as a cluster for this tutorial. 
It acts as a managing layer for the deployments. To follow this tutorial ensure that you 
have a kubernetes up and running.

Depending on your situation you can use a local (running on a single node) cluster or a cloud cluster.

## Local Setup

A local cluster can be done via the `minicube` application. It is a cheap and easy option for testing deployments.

>Be aware that your operating system and hardware need to support virtualization. 

To install `minicube` follow the up-to-date instructions (available for linux / macOS / windows) provided [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

## Cloud Setup

Instructions for the cloud setup can be found [here](https://github.com/clc3-CloudComputing/clc3-ws19/tree/master/3%20Kubernetes/exercise%203.1).
